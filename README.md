trigger-word-detection based on the project in coursera

task1 - cleaning the audio files, actually the sam words spoken was recorded by people, so I need to exactly and manually trim the clips to include just the sam sound and also the format of the recorded sound was in opus, so had to convert it to wave file

task2 - clean the audio samples such that they are 10s long and have a sampling frequency in common
